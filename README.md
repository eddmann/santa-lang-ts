# santa-lang

An functional, C-like programming language for solving Advent of Code problems.

## Why?

Over the past several years I have been slowly working through the previous Advent of Code calendars.
For each calendar I opt to solve the problems in a new programming language, to familiarise myself with other ways of understanding and working.
However, there comes a time in each calendar that I grow to dislike some aspect of the language.
So I had an idea... why not give this whole programming langauge design a go.
That way if I grow to dislike this language, I only have myself to blame!

Welcome `santa-lang`, my tree-walking interpreted programming language designed to help tackle Advent of Code problems.
